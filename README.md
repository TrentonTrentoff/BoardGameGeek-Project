# BoardGameGeek-Project

This is a work-in-progress tool designed to create a customisable filter search for a board game through a user's BoardGameGeek profile using the BoardGameGeek API. 

Currently it supports searching via number of players and time of game, but features in the future will be searching based off rank in BGG, as well as weight and average rating of game.
